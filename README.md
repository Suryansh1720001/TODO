# ðŸ“± Project: Task-Tonic 

In todays world, we tend to putting off doing something that is important to do, till another day or time, because we donâ€™t want to do it at the moment. Letâ€™s consider a simple scenario - we may want to register for some scholarship and we procrastinate so much that we eventually end up missing the deadline!
<br>
## ðŸ“œ Description
* This is an Android application which is a Task Manager which can serve as a daily task planner.
* Users can categorize their taks into different categories that help them prioritize tasks and implement them effectively.
* It also provides a monthly analysis of the work done by the user.
