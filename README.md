# Project: Task-Tonic 

Many a time it happens that we woke up with a plan in mind to execute for the rest of the day but we often indulge in activities we donâ€™t want to do we do it 
because we think that we have so much time to execute our plan. We end up wasting a lot of our precious time on stuff that is not really meaningful to us.
Sometimes we end up having a pile of tasks to accomplish with a very limited time at hand. Often times backlogs are not even possible to complete,
for example studying the whole syllabus just before the exam! <br>
