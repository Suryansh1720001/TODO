# Project: Task-Tonic 

In todays world, we tend to putting off doing something that is important to do, till another day or time, because we don’t want to do it at the moment. Let’s consider a simple scenario - we may want to register for some scholarship and we procrastinate so much that we eventually end up missing the deadline!
